# Fake-News-Detection-System-

Fake News Detection System (Python)
Overview
The Fake News Detection System is a Python-based application that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to identify and classify news articles as either genuine or fake. The system utilizes a combination of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and logistic regression for accurate classification.

Features
1. Text Preprocessing
  Remove stop words and perform stemming to clean and simplify the text data.
  Use regular expressions to clean the text and handle special characters.
2. Feature Extraction with TF-IDF
  Utilize the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
  TF-IDF weighting helps capture the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.
3. Data Splitting
  Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
  Ensure a balanced distribution of genuine and fake news in both sets.
4. Logistic Regression Model
  Implement a logistic regression model using scikit-learn's LogisticRegression.
  Train the model on the training dataset to learn patterns and relationships between features and labels.
5. Model Evaluation
  Assess the accuracy of the trained model using the accuracy_score metric.
  Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset to ensure generalization.
